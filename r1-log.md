# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Lee Ingram

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on December 28th, 2017, Thursday.

## Log

### R1D1 
Bootstrapped a react app and added the Material Design components library. https://github.com/tigwyk/deimos-react/commit/0880de83c7b15d1f3ea3ba75b7097ae74279a02f

### R1D2
I attempted to write a rudimentary fetch lookup of the API I exposed from Deimos 2147 and mostly failed, but I learned a lot in the process. I scaled down my attempts and I may have it working soon. https://github.com/tigwyk/deimos-react/commit/c03c603c31d6e8097b51f48a8386bdf816ef239b https://github.com/tigwyk/spacerpg/commits?author=tigwyk&since=2017-12-29T08:00:00Z&until=2017-12-30T08:00:00Z

### R1D3
Got the API lookup working correctly from ReactJS to my python Flask backend using cookies to manage authentication. https://github.com/tigwyk/deimos-react/commits/master , https://github.com/tigwyk/spacerpg/commits/master

### R1D4
Poked around at the React Material Design Component library and tried making a LayoutGrid. https://github.com/tigwyk/deimos-react/commits/master https://github.com/tigwyk/spacerpg/commits/master

### R1D5
Tried to fix a bug with authentication from other computers from ReactJS to the Flask API. Not sure why it doesn't seem to work on other computers. https://github.com/tigwyk/spacerpg/commits/master

### R1D6
I think I fixed the pesky authentication bug and I moved on to fixing up some CSS to make things look prettier. https://github.com/tigwyk/deimos-react/commits/master https://github.com/tigwyk/spacerpg/commits/master
