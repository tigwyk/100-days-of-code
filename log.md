# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Dec 28 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I set up a create-react-app bootstrap for my app: a front-end for Deimos 2147 (a webgame I'm writing). I made a git repo for it and uploaded my first few commits playing around with react. I also learned how to use the react development server's hot-reload feature.

**Thoughts**: React is really neat and I'm excited to continue learning it. I like the simplicity combined with the power to do complex things.

### Day 2: Dec 29 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I attempted to write a rudimentary fetch lookup of the API I exposed from Deimos 2147 and mostly failed, but I learned a lot in the process. I scaled down my attempts and I may have it working soon.

**Thoughts**: Combining React and python Flask is ... difficult, to say the least.

### Day 3: Dec 30 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I finally got the basic fetch API call working with cookies so that it properly has access to the character API endpoint and can show character name, attributes, etc. Took me the entire hour to get this working after trying various methods.

**Thoughts**: I'm ecstatic that I've combined Flask-Login to handle authentication along with the API and the ReactJS front-end to manage the visual aspect of where all the API results end up on the page. This is FASCINATING!

### Day 4: Jan 1 2018, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I poked around at the React Material Components for Web library and added a LayoutGrid to see how the data looks. It's... not laid out properly but we're getting somewhere!

**Thoughts**: This library was difficult to use since I wasn't aware of all the pieces I needed to install beforehand.
