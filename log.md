# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Dec 28 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I set up a create-react-app bootstrap for my app: a front-end for Deimos 2147 (a webgame I'm writing). I made a git repo for it and uploaded my first few commits playing around with react. I also learned how to use the react development server's hot-reload feature.

**Thoughts**: React is really neat and I'm excited to continue learning it. I like the simplicity combined with the power to do complex things.

### Day 2: Dec 29 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I attempted to write a rudimentary fetch lookup of the API I exposed from Deimos 2147 and mostly failed, but I learned a lot in the process. I scaled down my attempts and I may have it working soon.

**Thoughts**: Combining React and python Flask is ... difficult, to say the least.
