# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Dec 29 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I set up a create-react-app bootstrap for my app: a front-end for Deimos 2147 (a webgame I'm writing). I made a git repo for it and uploaded my first few commits playing around with react. I also learned how to use the react development server's hot-reload feature.

**Thoughts**: React is really neat and I'm excited to continue learning it. I like the simplicity combined with the power to do complex things.
